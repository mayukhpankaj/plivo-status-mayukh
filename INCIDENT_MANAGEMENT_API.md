### Severity Levels
- **low** - Minor issues with minimal impact
- **medium** - Moderate issues affecting some users
- **high** - Major issues affecting many users
- **critical** - Complete service outage

## Automatic Service Status Updates

The system automatically updates service status based on active incidents:

### Status Mapping
- **No active incidents** â†’ `operational`
- **Low severity incidents** â†’ `degraded`
- **Medium severity incidents** â†’ `degraded`
- **High severity incidents** â†’ `partial_outage`
- **Critical severity incidents** â†’ `major_outage`

### When Updates Occur
- âœ… When incident is created
- âœ… When incident severity is changed
- âœ… When incident status is changed
- âœ… When incident is resolved
- âœ… When incident is deleted

## Real-time Features

### WebSocket Events
- `incident_created` - New incident notifications
- `incident_updated` - Incident update notifications
- `service_status_changed` - Service status change notifications

### Event Data
